## Building HTTP Protocol from Scratch with Go


I am building a cURL-like HTTP Protocol from Scratch with Go to GET a better understanding about how networking, TCP, and HTTP work on a lower level. I am doing this in Go, because it's a great fast language with simple syntax that I think can be leveraged extremely well in this scenarioâ€”particularly Go-routines and structural typing.

### Learning Sources

I am using RFCs (Request for Comments) that have the original text about how th . Particularly, these are the versions I am using:

- [RFC 793: Transmission Control Protocol](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt)
- [RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt)
- RFC 7230-7235: HTTP/1.1 (updated versions)
